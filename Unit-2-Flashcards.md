What is **Probability**?
?
The measure of the likelihood of an event occurring. It can be expressed as a fraction, decimal (range $0 	o 1$), or percent (range $0 	o 100%$.
<br>
*Example: A probability of 0 means an impossible event (e.g., 2+2=5), while a probability of 1 means a certain event (e.g., 2+2=4).*

***

What is **Theoretical Probability**?
?
Probability that is predicted or estimated based on the possible number of outcomes, without performing an actual experiment. It relies on reason and mathematical calculation.
<br>
*Example: The theoretical probability of flipping a coin and getting heads is 50%, calculated without actually flipping the coin.*

***

What is **Sample Space (S)**?
?
The set of all possible outcomes for an event.
<br>
*Example: For a single coin flip, the sample space S = {Heads, Tails}. For rolling a standard six-sided die, S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.*

***

What is **Event Space (A)**?
?
The set of all outcomes that are considered "desired" for a specific event.
<br>
*Example: When rolling a die, if the event is "rolling an even number," the event space A = {2, 4, 6}.*

***

What is **Experimental Probability**?
?
Probability calculated based on the results of an actual experiment or observation.
<br>
*Example: If you flip a coin 100 times and get 48 heads, the experimental probability of getting heads is 48/100 or 0.48.*

***

What is the **Complement of an Event (A')**?
?
The event that A does not occur. The probability of the complement is $P(A') = 1 - P(A)$.
<br>
*Example: If the probability of rain (A) is 0.3, then the probability of no rain (A') is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.*

***

What are **Independent Events**?
?
Two events, A and B, are independent if the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other event occurring.
<br>
*Example: Flipping a coin twice. The outcome of the first flip does not affect the outcome of the second flip.*

***

What are **Dependent Events**?
?
Two events, A and B, are dependent if the occurrence of one event affects the probability of the other event occurring.
<br>
*Example: Drawing two cards from a deck without replacement. The probability of the second draw depends on the outcome of the first draw.*

***

What is **Conditional Probability ($P(B|A)$)**?
?
The probability of an event B occurring, given that another event A has already occurred.
<br>
*Example: The probability of drawing a second ace from a deck, given that the first card drawn was an ace and not replaced.*

***

What are **Mutually Exclusive Events**?
?
Two events that cannot occur at the same time. The probability of both events occurring simultaneously is 0 ($P(A 
 B) = 0$).
<br>
*Example: When rolling a single die, the events "rolling an even number" and "rolling an odd number" are mutually exclusive.*

***

What are **Non-Mutually Exclusive Events**?
?
Two events that can occur at the same time. The probability of both events occurring simultaneously is not 0 ($P(A 
 B) 
e 0$).
<br>
*Example: When rolling a single die, the events "rolling an even number" and "rolling a number greater than 3" are non-mutually exclusive (both can occur if you roll a 4 or 6).*

***

What is a **Probability Tree Diagram**?
?
A diagram used to organize thinking and visualize the probabilities of sequences of events, especially when there are multiple cases to consider.
<br>
*Example: A tree diagram can show the probabilities of different outcomes when flipping a coin multiple times or drawing cards without replacement.*

#flashcards/Unit-2/Formulas

What is the formula for **Theoretical Probability**?
?
$$
P(A) = \frac{n(A)}{n(S)}
$$
Where $n(A)$ is the number of items in the event space (desired outcomes) and $n(S)$ is the number of items in the sample space (all possible outcomes).
<br>
*Example: The probability of rolling a 4 on a six-sided die is $P(4) = 1/6$.*

***

What is the formula for **Experimental Probability**?
?
$$ 
P(A) = \frac{\# of times \ A \ occurred}{\# of trials}
$$ 
<br>
*Example: If a basketball player attempts 20 free throws and makes 15, the experimental probability of making a free throw is $15/20 = 0.75$.*

***

What is the formula for the **Complement of an Event**?
?
$$ 
P(A') = 1 - P(A)
$$ 
Where $P(A')$ is the probability that event A does not occur, and $P(A)$ is the probability that event A occurs.
<br>
*Example: If the probability of a sunny day is 0.6, the probability of a non-sunny day is $1 - 0.6 = 0.4$.*

***

What is the **Multiplicative Property for two Independent Events**?
?
$$ 
P(A\cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)
$$ 
This formula calculates the probability that both event A and event B occur when they are independent.
<br>
*Example: The probability of flipping a head (A) and then rolling a 6 (B) is $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B) = 0.5 \cdot (1/6) = 1/12$.*

***

What is the **Multiplicative Property for two Dependent Events**?
?
$$ 
P(A\cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B|A)
$$ 
This formula calculates the probability that both event A and event B occur when they are dependent.
<br>
*Example: The probability of drawing an ace (A) from a deck, and then drawing a king (B) without replacement, is $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B|A) = (4/52) \cdot (4/51)$.*

***

What is the formula for **Conditional Probability**?
?
$$ 
P(B|A) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(A)}
$$ 
This formula calculates the probability of event B occurring given that event A has already occurred.
<br>
*Example: If the probability of having a cold and a cough is 0.05, and the probability of having a cold is 0.2, then the probability of having a cough given you have a cold is $0.05 / 0.2 = 0.25$.*

***

What is the **Rule of Sum for Non-Mutually Exclusive Events**?
?
$$ 
P(A\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\cap B)
$$ 
This formula calculates the probability that event A or event B (or both) occur when they can happen at the same time.
<br>
*Example: The probability of drawing a red card (A) or a face card (B) from a deck. Since some face cards are red, you subtract the probability of drawing a red face card to avoid double-counting.*

***

What is the **Rule of Sum for Mutually Exclusive Events**?
?
$$ 
P(A\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)
$$ 
This formula calculates the probability that event A or event B occur when they cannot happen at the same time.
<br>
*Example: The probability of rolling a 2 (A) or a 4 (B) on a single die is $P(A) + P(B) = 1/6 + 1/6 = 2/6 = 1/3$.*
