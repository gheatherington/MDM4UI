What is **Qualitative or Categorical Data**?
?
It is data that describes qualities or characteristics and is collected through observations, interviews, or questionnaires. This type of data can be observed but not measured.

?
A type of qualitative data where categories are assigned arbitrary, non-numerical labels. The order of the categories does not matter.
<br>
*Example: Assigning numbers to different eye colors, like 1 for blue, 2 for brown, and 3 for green. The numbers are just labels and have no mathematical value.*

?
A type of qualitative data where the categories have a meaningful and logical order or ranking.
<br>

What is a **Double-Barrelled Question**?
?
A question that asks about two or more different issues at once, making it difficult for the respondent to answer accurately.
<br>

***

What is a **Population** in the context of sampling?
?
The entire group of individuals that you want to study or draw conclusions about.

*Example: A person might over-report how often they exercise because they want to appear healthy.*

***

What is **Non-Response Bias**?
?
A type of bias that occurs when the people who choose not to participate in a survey are systematically different from those who do participate.

?
A type of selection bias where some groups in the population are inadequately represented in the sample.

What is **Household Bias**?
?
A type of selection bias that occurs when groups of different sizes are polled equally, leading to a misrepresentation of the population.
<br>
*Example: Surveying an equal number of people from each state, despite massive differences in state populations, would give smaller states disproportionate influence.*

What is **Voluntary Response Bias**?
?
A type of bias that occurs when a sample is composed of volunteers who have chosen to participate. These volunteers often have strong opinions, leading to skewed results.
<br>
*Example: An online poll asking about a controversial topic will likely attract people who feel very strongly one way or the other.*
