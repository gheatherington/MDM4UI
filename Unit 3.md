# Types of Data
- ## Qualitative OR Categorical - Non number values
	- **Nominal** - when categories are assigned to arbitrary numbers
	- **Ordinal** - when categories are assigned to meaningful & logical numbers
- ## Quantitative OR Numerical - Numerical
	- **Discrete** - from a count (Whole #)
	- **Continuous** - from a measurement (Decimal places)
- **Experimental** - data from an experiment, where researches are controlling the conditions
- **Observational** - data from watching a situation, NO researcher interventions occur
- **Microdata** - data referring to a single individual OR Individual units of data
- **Aggregate** - a combination of more than one piece of data
- **Primary** - data collected by the researcher
	- IE. Survey, interview, experiment, observation
- **Secondary** - data that has been previously collected

## Ways of Showing Data
- Frequency distribution table
- Stem and Leaf plot
- Graphs
## Ways of Collecting Data
- Observational Study
	- Recording behaviour without interfering
- Experimental Study
	- Controlling for one variable to see the effect on the other variable
- Surveys
	- Individuals provide information about themselves and their opinions

# Types of Survey Question
- **Open** - respondent can respond how they want
	- IE. Written Response
- **Closed** - more common, pick from set
	- **Information** - gather information about the respondent
	- **Checklist** - Selects as many options as they life (often more than 1)
		- IE. What kind of music do you like?
		- **NOTE:*** ALWAYS include a *Other* Option
	- **Ranking** - multiple options, ranked via a metric
		- IE. What is the most important fitness feature?
		- **NOTE:*** Include a scale
	- **Rating** - rate a single statement/item
		- IE. on a scale from 1-10, or how would you rate $x$
## Things to Avoid
- Unclear Question
	- Question should be easy to understand; written simply. AVOID:
		- Negatives
		- Slang
		- Overlap
	- BE:
		- Specific
		- One question at a time
		- Answerable by everyone
- Bad Ethics
	- Personal Info
		- Names
		- Emails
		- Phone
		- Address
### Bias
- **Leading Question**
	- Lead the respondent to the "correct" answer
	- Don't influence with your opinion
	- IE. "Do you believe $x$ to be true?"
- **Loaded Question**
	- Don't assume anything of the respondent
	- IE. "What do you love about $x$"
- **Double-Barrelled Question**
	- No doubling up

# Sampling
## Population
- Whole group you are trying to collect data for
- **Census**
	- Surveying the entire population
- **Parameter**
	- Data gathered from the population
## Sample
- Small section of the population, used to get an idea of the population
- Use when population is too big (too much/too much money)
- **Statistic**
	- Data from sample
- **Inference**
	- Conclusion about population based on data from a sample
# Sampling Techniques
- **Random Sampling** (Best)
	- Every member of the population must have the same likelihood of being picked
- **Non-Random Sampling** -  some parts have lower to no chance of being selected
	- **Convenience** - people who are easy to reach
		- Usually Bias 
	- **Voluntary** - people who get to involve themselves
		- Leads to people with strong opinions responding (bias)
- **Simple random** - Each person in the sample is chosen randomly
	- Each combination is equally likely
		- That means you could get a heavily single sided demographic
- **Systematic** 
	- An ordered list is formed of everyone from the population
	- A random starting point is selected and every $k^{th}$ is selected
- **Stratified Random**
	- Organized into groups based on a particular characteristic
	- Then a random sample is taken from each group
- **Cluster**
	- People are broken into clusters
	- Then some of the clusters are chosen to be apart of the sample
		- Every cluster should be identical
- **Multi-Stage**
	- Combines multiple techniques to get better data

# Types of Bias
## Measurement Bias
-  Problems with the measurement tool or method used to collect the data
- Examples:
	- Incorrectly calibrated measurement tool
	- Dishonest answers
	- Poorly designed survey questions
### Social Desirability Bias
- People want to be seen in a good light or tell people what they want to hear, therefore they lie
- They overstate "good" things and understate "bad" things
- *How to avoid*
	- Make it easy to give honest answers
	- Make it anonymous
### Non-Response Bias
- People refuse/can't/don't participate causing a lack of data
- They were ***given*** it and chose ***not*** to respond
- *Causes*:
	- Confusing questions
	- No appropriate option
	- Medium of survey (IE. phone for elderly)

## Selection Bias
- Errors made when selecting a sample
### Under-coverage
- When one particular (or more) is under represent
- Example
	- An online survey, meaning low incoming people with no internet access can answer
### Household Bias
- When groups of different sizes are polled equally
- Example
	- Taking equal # of people from each province/territory
### Voluntary Response Bias
- Occurs when people voluntarily choose to complete a survey
	- They were given it and they chose not to respond
- Results is only people with strong opinions

## Avoiding Bias
- it's hard to tell when data is biased
- Ways to avoid:
	- Selecting a sample randomly
	- Using accurate measurement tools
	- Wording survey questions carefully
	- The larger the sample the better

## Bias in Graphs (Distorting Graphs)
- Bar graphs must start at $0$
- Distorting scale, such as jump in y-axis
- Bad intervals on the x-axis
- Pictures of varying sizes 
- Cherry picking data that proves a point
